# 🤖 Freak Detector  
A fun little project that uses your webcam to detect **your face expressions** and **hand gestures**, and then shows a matching **reaction GIF**.  
Everything runs locally using **MediaPipe** + **OpenCV**, and you can use **your own custom GIFs**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
The app watches your webcam and reacts:

- 👅 **Tongue Out** → shows `catkitty.gif`
- 😴 **Eyes Closed** → shows `crackingup.gif`
- 🤔 **Thinking pose (finger touching head)** → shows `think.gif`
- 🖐️ **Hand Raise (index finger up)** → shows `instagrammonkey.gif`
- 😱 **Hand On Head / Oh No moment** → shows `ohmg.gif`

You can also manually trigger reactions using keys `1–5`.
